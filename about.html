            <div id="bio">Exceptionally appreciative of the unusual and curious, Michelle, like all good college students, is one to very much enjoy Midnight Dinners (<i>Night Circus</i> anyone?). Or perhaps more accurately, sporadic mealtimes in the dead of night to spur her exceedingly nocturnal lifestyle. She fervently agrees with the notion that a carefully orchestrated atmosphere may spread magic and believes that we are all not so different from when we were kids--just bigger. Indeed, one may often find her pretending to be a genius, a captain, or another favorite character of hers in hopes of inspiring herself to be better.In her free time, she enjoys finding herself more work to do, typically involving the scheming of  new projects and adventures to partake in. Michelle values the idea of the Wildcard and aspires to be, as the popular song puts it: "Everything at once." Putting it another way, she lacks decision-making skills, so she opts for everything. Often said to be unpredictable and too curious for her own good, Michelle enjoys odd ideas and has a healthy love for winter, rain, the silent hours between dusk and dawn, and STEAM. Please excuse her seemingly unending affinity for dark, neutral colors--they are rather slimming, after all.
