            Lumos is a device which allows hospital in-patients to control their ambient 
            environment and interact with loved ones. Its purpose is to combat hospital-induced
            delirium as well as irritation and loneliness, which may stem from the clinical
            environment. Lumos is a phyiscal controller with three key features:
            <ol>
                <li>Ambient lighting control</li>
                <li>Environment simulation</li>
                <li>The ability to interact with SendLove, a software 
                    interface that allows patients to view photos and 
                    messages sent by friends and family
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The controller interfaces with two external components: a LIFX smart bulb with 
            WiFi capabilities and a projector.

        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <div class="photo_frame"><img src="../assets/img/code/lumos_process/brainstorm.jpg"></div>
        <p>
            We began with the knowledge that we wanted to create a device to better the lives of others. 
            Using a series of ideation exercises (including post-its and clustering), 
            we compiled a 
            <a href="../assets/pdf/lumos_brainstorm.pdf">list of 26 possible ideas</a> and used this to gauge
            our interest as a group.
        </p>
        <p>
            We found the concept of designing for the "hospital room of the future" universally relatable
            (after all, everyone will inevitably go to the hospital at some point in their lives). The idea that
            the majority of modern hospital rooms are designed for the physician and not patient-centered was both 
            dismaying and something our members have experienced first-hand. After hearing a representative from 
            UCSF explain how widespread the issue of delirium is in hospital in-patients, we decided to make this 
            our core focus. We decided to tackle the root cause of delirium by creating a lighting system that would 
            improve the overall experience of long-term patients, both practically and emotionally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following this, we 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDgqwAwWmi238w_AWdjDvQdmLcPpmtPvvo6caHkzHvQ/edit?usp=sharing">
                created a deck 
            </a>
            detailing our general interest area, target user group, and important questions we would consider 
            in further distilling our product idea. In summary:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Target users:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Long-term patients in hospitals and other medical care facilities. 
            </li>
            <li>
                These facilities house patients for a week or more (such as rehabilitation and hospice centers), as well as the 
                nursing staff that interact with such patients during their stay. Because long-term patients are most 
                susceptible to lack of stimulation or depression from the clinical atmosphere of medical facilities, and 
                stay under medical supervision for extended periods of time, they require proper lighting for resting, reading, and living. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>NOTE: In retrospect, we realized that hospital room designers may also be part of our target user base. 
                These individuals not only improve the patient experience, but can also make ambient technology customizable 
                and cost effective for hospitals. This is a note for future user research, as it may be worthwhile to 
                speak with hospital design directors and other such professionals to uncover what currently prevents hospitals 
                from adapting existing ambient lighting technology.</i>
